            <p>This carrot cake recipe with a homemade cream cheese frosting is my favorite, and I have tried many carrot cakes!
            It's moist, easy to make with grated carrots, and so delicious! Our top-rated carrot cake recipe is moist, light, fluffy, and topped with a rich cream cheese frosting. What's not to love?</p>
