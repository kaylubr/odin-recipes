                <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 8 minutes. </li>
                <li>Combine 1 3/4 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. Pour in yeast mixture; mix well until dough comes together. </li>
                <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup flour if dough is too sticky. </li>
                <li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a greased pizza pan. </li>
                <li>Add your favorite toppings, and bake. Enjoy! </li>
